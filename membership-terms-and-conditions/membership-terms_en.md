## Preamble
Welcome to AcmeVPN!

To ensure that you fully understand the rules governing our membership services, we have established these detailed terms. Please read them carefully to better understand and make use of our services.

**Important Notice**: By using AcmeVPN membership services, you are deemed to have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Membership Terms of Service (hereinafter referred to as the "Membership Terms").

## 0. Definitions
To avoid ambiguity, the following definitions shall have the meanings set forth below:
- **Membership Types**: Includes paid memberships (SVIP, VIP) and free memberships (Free Trial, Basic Membership, Referral Reward Basic Membership).
- **VIP**: Basic paid membership benefits.
- **SVIP**: Premium paid membership benefits, offering faster speeds and additional device connections compared with VIP.
- **Basic Membership**: Free membership obtained through advertisements or promotional activities, with benefits below VIP level.
- **Referral Reward Basic Membership**: Earned by successfully referring new users who register and complete their first payment, offering the same benefits as Basic Membership.
- **Free Trial**: A one-time 3-day free trial available to new users upon initial registration.
- **Purchase Methods**: 
  - Subscription Purchase: Recurring billing via third-party payment platforms (e.g., Stripe) on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis;
  - One-time Purchase: A single upfront payment for fixed-term membership benefits.
- **Validity Period Calculation**: The validity period of services shall be calculated by natural months continuously from the actual time of activation, expiring at the same date and time in the corresponding month. When the target month does not have the activation date (e.g., activated on January 31 but February has no 31st day), the expiry date is adjusted to the last day of that month. For subsequent renewals, if the target month has the original activation date, the original date is restored.

## 1. Membership Purchase Methods
You may purchase membership services for your AcmeVPN account through the following methods:
- **Free Trial**: New users are entitled to a one-time 3-day free trial upon first registration.
- **Subscription Purchase**: You may purchase VIP or SVIP memberships on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.
- **One-time Purchase**: You may purchase a fixed-term VIP or SVIP membership service by making a single payment.
- **Referral Rewards**: By successfully referring a new user who registers and makes their first payment, you may receive Basic Membership time based on that user's first paid membership: a first-time VIP purchase grants you 1 month of Basic Membership, and a first-time SVIP purchase grants you 2 months. The gifted duration is calculated in natural months from the effective time of that first purchase and is not affected by later upgrades or downgrades. Please refer to the invitation page for detailed rules.
- **Purchase Restrictions**: When your subscription membership is still active, the system does not allow buying an additional one-time membership. Likewise, if a one-time membership has not yet expired, you cannot initiate a new subscription. Please wait until the current membership expires before switching purchase methods.

## 2. Membership Validity Period

### 2.1 Paid Memberships
AcmeVPN offers monthly, quarterly, and annual paid membership services. The validity period is calculated by natural months, maintaining the same time point:
- **Monthly Membership**: From the time of activation, extends forward by 1 natural month, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Quarterly Membership**: From the time of activation, extends forward by 3 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Annual Membership**: From the time of activation, extends forward by 12 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Biannual Membership**: From the time of activation, extends forward by 24 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date.

**Handling Rules for Non-existent Dates**:
When the target month does not have the activation date (e.g., monthly membership activated on January 31, but February has no 31st day), the system adjusts the expiry date to the last day of that month.
- **Subscription Renewals**: For subsequent auto-renewals, if the target month has the original activation date, the original date is restored;
- **One-time Purchases**: Only applies to the expiry time calculation for that specific purchase.

**Calculation Examples**:

**One-time Purchase Examples**:
- **Example 1**: If you purchase a monthly VIP membership at 8:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on February 1, 2025, the membership will expire at 8:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on March 1, 2025, and manual repurchase is required after expiry;
- **Example 2**: If you purchase a monthly VIP membership at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on January 31, 2025, since February has no 31st day, the membership will expire at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on February 28, 2025, and manual repurchase is required after expiry.

**Subscription Renewal Examples**:
- **Example 3**: If you subscribe to monthly VIP membership (auto-renewal) at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on January 31, 2025, the first billing cycle will expire and auto-renew at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on February 28, 2025, and the second billing cycle will expire at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on March 31, 2025 (restoring the original date of 31st).

### 2.2 Free Reward Membership
**Basic Membership**:
- The validity period is calculated continuously for 24 hours from the time of redemption.
- **Example**: If you redeem a 1-day Basic membership at 2:00 PM (Singapore Standard Time) on February 1, 2025, it will expire at 2:00 PM on February 2, 2025.
**Referral Reward Basic Membership**:
- When the referred user makes their first VIP purchase, the referrer receives 1 month of Basic Membership; when the first purchase is SVIP, the referrer receives 2 months.
- The gifted duration is calculated in natural months from the time the referred user's first paid membership becomes effective. For example, if the referred user first purchases VIP at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on February 1, 2025, the 1-month Basic Membership will expire at 10:00 AM on March 1, 2025.
- The reward is determined solely by the initial purchase type and will not change due to subsequent upgrades, downgrades, or renewals.

### 2.3 Subscription Payments
The billing date for subscription payments is subject to the rules of the payment platform (e.g., Stripe). However, membership validity periods shall be calculated according to these Membership Terms.

### 2.4 Time Zone Calculation
The validity period of all membership services (including paid and free memberships) shall be determined according to the user's local time zone at the time of obtaining, redeeming, or purchasing the service, and calculated continuously in hours from that moment.

## 4. Refund Policy

### 4.1 Refund Terms
- Since all new users are offered a 3-day free VIP trial to fully experience and evaluate service quality prior to payment, and as membership services constitute digital services which are deemed activated upon purchase, all paid membership services are non-refundable once effective, except as required by applicable law (e.g., failure to provide services due to our reasons, material service defects, erroneous charges, etc.);
- You may cancel auto-renewal at any time by clicking "Manage Membership" on the "My Membership" page, which links to a third-party payment platform (e.g., Stripe). Once canceled, no further charges will be incurred;
- After canceling auto-renewal, you may continue to use the services until the end of the current billing cycle, however, fees for unused portions of the current billing cycle will not be refunded.

### 4.2 Free Trial Recommendations
During your free trial, we recommend that you:
- Test server connection speed and stability;
- Evaluate application functionality and interface experience;
- Determine whether the service meets your usage needs;
- If you have questions, please contact us through the help center on AcmeVPN website or app, or send an email to support@acmevpn.io.

## 5. Free Trial Rules
- Free trials are limited to new users once only and terminate immediately upon commencement of any subscription purchases or one-time purchases of paid memberships. Therefore, once you begin a subscription purchase or one-time purchase of paid memberships, the free trial will automatically end and cannot be restored;
- Deleting accounts and re-registering does not entitle a user to an additional free trial;
- Users are expected to fully evaluate service quality and usage needs during the trial period;
- If AcmeVPN subsequently offers additional membership promotions, the specific benefits and applicable conditions shall be subject to the activity terms officially published by our company and shall be deemed a supplement to these Membership Terms.

## 6. Membership Stacking and Priority

### 6.1 General Principle
Only one membership service may be active at any given time.

### 6.2 Priority Order
Remaining time for the same type of membership (e.g., multiple SVIPs or multiple VIPs) will be automatically combined for use.
Different types of memberships will take effect in the following order of priority:
1. **SVIP Membership** (paid SVIP)
2. **VIP Membership** (paid VIP)
3. **Basic Membership** (including Referral Reward Basic Membership)

#### 6.3 Upgrade and Downgrade Rules
#### 6.3.1 Upgrade Rules
- Users may upgrade their current subscription purchase by paying the corresponding price difference (these upgrade rules do not apply to one-time purchases). Upgrades are divided into the following two categories:
  - Type Upgrade (VIP → SVIP, same or longer duration)
    1. Monthly VIP → Monthly/Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    3. Annual VIP → Annual SVIP
  - Duration Upgrade (same type, longer duration)
    1. Monthly VIP → Quarterly/Annual VIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Annual VIP
    3. Monthly SVIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    4. Quarterly SVIP → Annual SVIP
- Upon upgrade, users enjoy upgraded service benefits immediately. However, the validity period of services shall remain based on the start time of the original subscription and shall not be reset.
- **Example**: If a user subscribes to monthly VIP at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on January 1 and upgrades to monthly SVIP at 3:00 PM on January 3, the user enjoys monthly SVIP benefits from 3:00 PM on January 3, but the service period of the subscription service remains January 1, 10:00 AM through February 1, 10:00 AM.
#### 6.3.2 Downgrade Rules
- If a user holds multiple subscriptions of different types, downgrades shall take effect only after the current billing cycle ends. Lower-priority subscription services shall automatically take effect upon the expiration of higher-priority subscription services.

## 7. Usage Rules and Restrictions
- Once a membership validity period begins, it cannot be suspended or extended except as expressly provided by law or these Membership Terms;
- Membership services remain effective regardless of usage frequency or login status. If you delete your account, uninstall AcmeVPN, or fail to use membership services during the membership validity period, the membership service remains active;
- Membership benefits are non-transferable and may not be shared with others. If an account sharing or other abnormal usage is detected, AcmeVPN reserves the right to ban accounts or terminate membership services;
- Users must not obtain Basic membership fraudulently through malicious practices. If such malicious practices or other malicious conduct are detected, AcmeVPN reserves the right to issue warnings, restrict functions, suspend services, ban accounts, or terminate membership services.
