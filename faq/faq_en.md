- For detailed membership priority and stacking rules, please refer to our Membership Terms of Service.

### 4.12 How Is the Membership Validity Period Calculated?

AcmeVPN offers monthly, quarterly, annual, and biannual paid membership services. The validity period is calculated by natural months, maintaining the same time point:

- **Monthly Membership**: From the time of successful purchase, extends forward by 1 natural month, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Quarterly Membership**: From the time of successful purchase, extends forward by 3 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Annual Membership**: From the time of successful purchase, extends forward by 12 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date;
- **Biannual Membership**: From the time of successful purchase, extends forward by 24 natural months, expiring at the same time on the corresponding date.

**Handling Rules for Non-existent Dates**:
When the target month does not have the purchase date (e.g., purchasing monthly membership on January 31, but February has no 31st day), the system adjusts the expiry date to the last day of that month.

- **Subscription Renewals**: For subsequent auto-renewals, if the target month has the original purchase date, the original date is restored;
- **One-time Purchases**: Only applies to the expiry time calculation for that specific purchase.

**Calculation Examples**:

**One-time Purchase Examples**:

- **Example 1**: If you purchase a one-time monthly Pro membership at 8:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on February 1, 2025, the membership will expire at 8:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on March 1, 2025, and requires manual repurchase after expiration;
- **Example 2**: If you purchase a one-time monthly Pro membership at 10:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on January 31, 2025, since February does not have 31 days, the membership will expire at 10:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on February 28, 2025, and requires manual repurchase after expiration.

**Subscription Renewal Examples**:

- **Example 3**: If you subscribe to monthly Pro membership (auto-renewal) at 10:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on January 31, 2025, the first billing cycle will expire and auto-renew at 10:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on February 28, 2025, and the second billing cycle will expire at 10:00 AM Singapore Standard Time on March 31, 2025 (resuming the original date of the 31st);
- **Example 4**: If you subscribe to quarterly Pro membership (auto-renewal) at 2:00 PM Singapore Standard Time on February 15, 2025, the first billing cycle will expire and auto-renew at 2:00 PM Singapore Standard Time on May 15, 2025, and the second billing cycle will expire at 2:00 PM Singapore Standard Time on August 15, 2025;
