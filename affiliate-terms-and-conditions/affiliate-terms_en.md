## 1. Overview of the Affiliate Program

### 1.2 Principles of Cooperation
This Affiliate Program operates based on the principles of legality, integrity, equality, and mutual benefit. Affiliate Members shall ensure that their promotional activities comply with applicable laws and these Terms. Any violations of law or breach of these Terms may result in termination of cooperation.

## 2. Application Eligibility and Requirements

### 2.1 Basic Eligibility
To apply to become an Affiliate Member or participate in the Affiliate Program, the applicants must:
- Be at least 18 years of age and possess full legal capacity.
- Own lawful and valid promotional channels (websites, blogs, social media accounts, etc.).
- Ensure promotional content complies with applicable laws, regulations, and public order and morality.
- Possess lawful and valid payment accounts for receiving commissions.

### 2.2 Prohibited Conditions
Applicants shall be ineligible to apply to become Affiliate Members or participate in the Affiliate Program under any of the following conditions:
- Being an individual or organization engaged in illegal or irregular activities.
- Using promotional channels involving pornography, violence, gambling, fraud, or other content.
- Having previously been expelled by AcmeVPN or other affiliate programs.
- Being a VPN service provider that directly competes with AcmeVPN, or being an employee of such provider.

### 2.3 Geographic Restrictions
For legal compliance and commercial considerations, AcmeVPN currently does not accept applicants from:
- Countries or regions under international sanctions.
- Jurisdictions where local law expressly prohibits the promotion of VPN services or affiliate marketing activities.
- Regions deemed to pose high political or economic risk.

AcmeVPN reserves the right to adjust the restriction list according to changes in legal policies. Applicants or Affiliate Members are prohibited from circumventing geographic restrictions through the use of fake addresses, proxy addresses, or other means. Any such attempt may result in immediate termination of the cooperation, clearance of account balances, and recovery of all paid commissions (if applicable).

### 2.4 Application Process
Applicants interested in joining the Affiliate Program should visit the Affiliate Program page on the AcmeVPN official website to apply using their personal email address. When applying, applicants should submit the following materials or information:
- Basic information and contact details of the individual or entity.
- Description of promotional channels (website links, social media accounts, etc.).
- Outline of expected promotional plans and strategies.
- Payment account information.

AcmeVPN will verify the authenticity and accuracy of the submitted materials prior to commission withdrawals. Affiliate Members who pass the verification will receive commissions according to the commission withdrawal process. Those who fail may be required to provide supplementary materials for clarification. If supplementary materials remain unsatisfactory, AcmeVPN reserves the right to refuse to distribute corresponding commissions.

## 3. Commission Structure and Incentive Mechanism

### 3.1 Basic Commission
- For new users who registered via your Exclusive Affiliate Link and successfully purchased a paid membership service for the first time, you will receive 40% of the actual payment amount for that order as commission (referred to as the "First Payment Commission").
- For subsequent renewal orders from that user, you will receive 36% of the actual payment amount for the order as commission (referred to as the "Renewal Commission").
- All commissions are calculated based on users' actual payment amounts. That is, when users receive a price reduction through promo codes, coupons, or discount activities, commissions are calculated based on the actual payment amount after the reduction. For example, if a new user purchases a package originally priced at $100 using a 20% discount, resulting in an actual payment amount of $80, the Affiliate Member will receive $32 as the First Payment Commission ($80 × 40%).

### 3.2 Monthly Performance Incentives
To incentivize high-performing Affiliate Members, AcmeVPN has established a Monthly Performance Incentive mechanism. Eligible Affiliate Members may receive corresponding additional commissions in the following month based on the number of Valid Orders successfully promoted during the current month.

#### 3.2.1 Statistical Period
The statistical period for Monthly Performance Incentives is from 00:00 on the first day of the month to 23:59 on the last day of the month in Singapore Standard Time, calculated based on order generation time.

#### 3.2.2 Incentive Implementation Rules

| Number of Valid Orders in the Current Month | Additional Commission Rate For the following Month |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 50-99 orders | Additional +2.5% |
| 100-149 orders | Additional +5% |
| 150-199 orders | Additional +7.5% |
| 200 orders and above | Additional +10% |

**Example**: If you successfully promote 100 Valid Orders in January, all confirmed commissions in February will be increased by an additional 5% on top of the basic commission calculation. Therefore:
- First Payment Commission: 45% of the users' actual payment amount (basic 40% + incentive 5%).
- Renewal Commission: 41% of the users' actual payment amount (basic 36% + incentive 5%).
**Important Note**: Monthly Performance Incentives are calculated based on all confirmed commissions in the following month and cannot be accumulated or transferred across months.

### 3.3 Tracking and Attribution Mechanism
- The tracking window for promotional activity is 30 days, starting from the user's first valid click. After account registration, the attribution relationship will be determined by the system based on invitation code information and other relevant technical identification methods.
- If new users complete their first payment within the tracking window, the order shall be attributed to that Affiliate Member.
- First payments occurring after the tracking window shall not be attributed for commission purposes.
- Once attribution is confirmed, subsequent renewal orders by that user will continue to be attributed to the same Affiliate Member.
- Only new users who first register for AcmeVPN accounts via Affiliate Members' Exclusive Affiliate Links are eligible for commission calculation.
- The system will use technical means such as email addresses and device fingerprints to distinguish between new and existing users, preventing duplicate calculations.

### 3.4 Commission Billing Scope
Only orders for paid membership services (VIP, SVIP) purchased by users are included in the commission billing scope. Orders for non-membership paid services or refund orders are excluded from the commission billing scope.
